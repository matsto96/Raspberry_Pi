Preparation for Lab 2
	1. Describe with code how cross-correlation can be used to find effective delay between audio signals with sampling frequency, f_s.
		Hint: For which delay does abs(cross-corr) has a maximum
	cc = np.correlation(signal_1, signal_2, mode='full')
	Delay = max(cc).index - num_samples
		
	2. 
		a. If you have a triangular array like in figure 4, with length d, and the sampling frequency is fs; 
			what is the maximum number of samples with delay that can be generated?
			
			Speed of sound ~ 343 m/s - V_sound
			Max_samples_between_microphones = (d/V_sound)/f_s
			
		b. Can you detect several different angles if the maximum delay between microphones is 2 samples or 4 samples?
		Hint: A wide range of angles will give the same combination of three delays (in integer numbers of samples), n21, n31 and n32!
			2 samples: Not many, only 6 angles possible. If you can recreate the complete wave, 
			it is possible to detect any angle
			4 samples:
